# Rust DataConverter Engine
This repository is part of a port of [DataConverter](https://github.com/PaperMC/DataConverter) to Rust.
This is the "engine" part of the DataConverter, that is the stuff that doesn't directly relate to Minecraft.
Much of the code here will resemble the Java code in that repository.
Like DataConverter, Rust DataConverter is licensed under LGPL-3.
